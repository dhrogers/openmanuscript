# The OpenManuscript script

This script creates an `.rtf` file from an `openmanuscript` database. 
The `.rtf` file can be opened by any application that reads `.rtf` files, 
but testing is done only on Microsoft Word.

## Example

The following command will create a file named `manuscript.rtf`, using the
author and manuscript files noted.

```
    openms --authorfile author.json --manuscriptfile ms.json
```
