# OpenManuscript tools

For more information about these tools, contact david@dhrogers.com.

## Introduction

This is a set of tools that support `openmanuscript` workflows.

## Requirements

Requirements for this toolset:

- **python 3.x**
- Modules as listed in the ``setup.py`` file. These will be installed
  automatically if ``pip`` setup is used, per instructions.


## Installation 

These tools installs in the normal python way. From the `tools/` directory, run:

```
pip3 install .
```

## Tools

### oms

This script is the standard OMS conversion script, with others being deprecated. 
Features will be added to this script to support all aspects of the OpenManuscript format.

The script looks at the type of the output file requested, and attempts to write 
out that type of file. The script will report on failure (if it can't write 
out that type of file).

By default, the tool assumes it is being run in the manuscript directory. If
this is not the case, an explicit path must set on the command line.

- Input/Output
	- ``--authorfile`` the name of the author json file in the ``manuscriptdir``. Defaults to ``author.json``
	- ``--manuscriptdir`` the name of the directory containing the open manuscript data. Defaults to ``.``
	- ``--manuscriptfile`` the name of the manuscript file in the ``manuscriptdir``. Defaults to ``manuscript.json``
	- ``--outputfile`` write output to this file, in the ``manuscriptdir``. Defaults to ``manuscript.docx``
	- ``--quotefile`` defines the scene file used for a beginning quote. Defaults to ``quote.md``.
	- ``--synopsisfile`` defines the scene file used for a synopsis. Defaults to ``synopsis.md``.
	- ``--tags`` define a list of tags used to filter the scenes for different operations. Scenes with tags that appear in this list are considered 'on'.
- Switches
	- ``--chaptersummary`` print a chapter summary, if there is one, at the beginning of each chapter
	- ``--filescenesep`` print the scene filename, instead of the normal ``###`` between scenes.
	- ``--notes`` print **notes** content in each scene, if present.
	- ``--quote`` if there is a quote scene file, include it at the beginning of the manuscript. The argument ``--quotefile`` defines the name of this file.
	- ``--specversion`` report the version of ``OpenManuscript`` specification that this tool supports.
	- ``--synopsis`` if there is a synopsis scene file, include it at the beginning of the manuscript. The argument ``--synopsisfile`` defines the name of this file.
	- ``--version`` report this application's version number and exit.
- Formatting
	- ``--font`` define the font for the manuscript. Both ``Times`` and ``Courier`` are valid values.
	- ``--fontsize`` define the font size for the manuscript. Default is ``12``.
	- ``--underline`` use underline to show emphasis (instead of bold or italics).ÃŸ


## Examples

The `example` directory contains a sample `openmanuscript` database, and two
output files - `` and `` - that show the results of the `oms` workflow.

The following commands use the `example/` directory from this repository, and assume 
that you have installed the tool, per instructions above, and are starting from 
within the `tools/` directory. 

The following command uses all default settings, and will create a file named `manuscript.docx`. 
This is run within the `example` directory.

```
cd ../example
oms
```

This command shows how to use several command line options to override defaults.

```
cd ../example
oms --authorfile a.json --manuscriptfile m.json --outputfile m.docx
```

This command is run from the `tools` directory, and shows an example in which
`oms` runs using explicit paths. In this case, the `manuscript.docx` file will
be written in the `tools` directory.

```
oms --manuscriptdir ../example --authorfile a.json --manuscriptfile m.json
```

Finally, this command will create the `manuscript.docx` file at a specific
location, per the `--outputfile` argument. In this case, it will create the file
in the user's home directory.

```
oms --manuscriptdir ../example --authorfile a.json --manuscriptfile m.json --outputfile ~/example_manuscript.docx
```
