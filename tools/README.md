# The OpenManuscript script

This script creates an *RTF* file from an *openmanuscript* database. The *RTF*
file can be opened by any application that reads *RTF* files, but testing is
done only on Microsoft Word.

## Example

The following command will create a file named *manuscript.rtf*, using the
author and manuscript files noted.

    openms --authorfile author.json --manuscriptfile ms.json
