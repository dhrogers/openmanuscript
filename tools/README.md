# OpenManuscript tools

For more information about these tools, contact **david *at* dhrogers *dot*
com**.

## Introduction

This is a set of tools that support **OpenManuscript** workflows.

## Requirements

Requirements for this toolset:

- **python 3.x**
- Modules as listed in the ``setup.py`` file. These will be installed
  automatically if ``pip`` setup is used, per instructions.


## Installation 

These tools installs in the normal python way. From the `tools/` directory, run:

```
pip3 install .
```

# Tools

## oms

![Page One](../img/pages.png)
*Example of manuscript pages generated by the oms tool*

This script outputs ``Word`` files (docx), as this is the industry standard 
for sharing manuscripts.

By default, the tool assumes it is being run in the manuscript directory. If
this is not the case, an explicit path must set on the command line.

### the \<include\> directive

This tool will include files one level deep. It looks in the `scenes` directory
for `filename` with the directive formatted this way:

```
<include>filename</include>
```

### command line arguments

- Input/Output
	- ``--authorfile`` the name of the author json file in the ``manuscriptdir``. Defaults to ``author.json``
	- ``--manuscriptdir`` the name of the directory containing the open manuscript data. Defaults to ``.``
	- ``--manuscriptfile`` the name of the manuscript file in the ``manuscriptdir``. Defaults to ``manuscript.json``
	- ``--outputfile`` write output to this file, in the ``manuscriptdir``. Defaults to ``manuscript.docx``
	- ``--include_tags`` define a list of tags that are 'on', and are included in any operation. Default is empty list, and all tags are included. 
	- ``--exclude_tags`` define a list of tags that are 'off', and are not included in any operation. Default is empty listy, and no tags are excluded.
- Switches
	- ``--chapterdesc`` print a chapter description, if there is one, instead of the chapter.
	- ``--chaptersummary`` print a chapter summary, if there is one, instead of the chapter.
	- ``--filescenesep`` print the scene filename, instead of the normal ``###`` between scenes.
	- ``--includesections`` if there are sections in scenes surrounded by arbitrary html tags, include those that are listed in this arg. 
	- ``--notes`` print **notes** content in each scene, if present.
- Formatting
	- ``--font`` define the font for the manuscript. Both ``Times`` and ``Courier`` are valid values.
	- ``--fontsize`` define the font size for the manuscript. Default is ``12``.
- Operations
	- ``--listscenes`` print a sorted list of the scenes defined by the other command line options 
	- ``--specversion`` report the version of ``OpenManuscript`` specification that this tool supports, then exit.
	- ``--version`` report this application's version number, then exit.


### Examples

The `example` directory contains a sample **OpenManuscript** database for examples
and testing.

The following commands use the `example/` directory from this repository, and assume 
that you have installed the tool, per instructions above, and are starting from 
within the `tools/` directory. 

The following command uses all default settings, and will create a file named `manuscript.docx`. 
This is run within the `example` directory.

```
cd ../example
oms
```

This command shows how to use several command line options to override defaults.

```
cd ../example
oms --authorfile a.json --manuscriptfile m.json --outputfile m.docx
```

This command is run from the `tools` directory, and shows an example in which
`oms` runs using explicit paths. In this case, the `manuscript.docx` file will
be written in the `tools` directory.

```
oms --manuscriptdir ../example --authorfile a.json --manuscriptfile m.json
```

Finally, this command will create the `manuscript.docx` file at a specific
location, per the `--outputfile` argument. In this case, it will create the file
in the user's home directory.

```
oms --manuscriptdir ../example --authorfile a.json --manuscriptfile m.json --outputfile ~/example_manuscript.docx
```

### Known issues

``oms`` uses several other libraries under the covers to write out ``docx``
files, and is limited by those tools. In particular, the current version of
``oms`` has the following limitations:

1. **Issue** Numbered lists do not reset. If you have numbered lists across chapters,
these chapters will share a single numbering system. A fix is in development,
and will be released when it is available.

    - *Solution* Use bullet (unordered) lists whenever possible.

2. **Issue** Footnotes will appear at the end of a chapter, but not in the footer of the
pages. Footnotes also suffer from the same numbering issue as #1. It is assumed
that most fiction manuscripts will use the footnotes as reminders of ideas and
edits, and not part of a finished manuscript, so this is not a show stopper.

    - *Solution* Use footnotes as internal notes for edits and ideas, and not as
      part of a final manuscript.

## oms2outline

This tool creates an ``html``-based table outline, using information in the project's manuscript ``json`` file. Scene files are linked in the **Scenes** column. See the example below.

![outline](../img/outline.png)
*Example of outline page generated by the oms tool.*

The command has the same options as ``oms`` (shown above), with the addition of one to control the columns shown.

- Input/Output
	- ``--columns`` define a list of columns that are used to created the
      outline. Possible values are the tags defined for a scene in the
      OpenManuscript specification. If a scene does not have a value for a 
      column, a blank is shown. Check the output of the tool's help for a 
      list of default values.

## omsedit

This is a convenience script that, when run in a valid OpenManuscript database
directory, will create a new script from a template scene file and run the `vi`
editor. In particular, it will perform the following operations:

```
    cp scenes/template.md scenes/(filename).md
    vi scenes/(filename).md
```
