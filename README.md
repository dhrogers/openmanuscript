This is OpenManuscript, a data format specification for writing manuscripts.

For more information about this specification, contact david@dhrogers.com.

## Introduction

This is a specification for OpenManuscript v1.0, a database for an ASCII text-based workflow for creating manuscripts. 

The vision for this data format is to provide a text-based, flexible way of
capturing, organizing and promoting the sometimes chaotic progression of ideas
that go into making a novel. The OpenManuscript format is text-based, so it
isn't locked behind the firewall of a particular application. Rather, it is
a format that can be edited by simple tools, compiled into any format, and
returned to again and again, without the worry that the format will be
unreadable down the road because the software you started with has upgraded to 
a version that no longer reads your data, or simply no longer exists.

OpenManuscript separates the data from the tool, which is a very powerful
mechanism for invention. With this format, a variety of tools can work on the
same data, and a writer can switch between tools, creating a workflow that best
supports an individual writer's specific way of crafting novels. 

At the most basic level, a manuscript is a pairing of an author and a sequence
of chapters. Meta data tags throughout the specification capture additional data
that can be included to enrich a properly formatted manuscript.

OpenManuscript defines a set of required and optional directories and files. This specification allows other files and directories to be present under the main manuscript directory, but they are not part of this  specification.
