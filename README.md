## Introduction

This is a specification for OpenManuscript v1.0, a database for an ASCII text-based workflow for writing fiction, managing drafts, and creating [fiction manuscripts](https://www.shunn.net/format/story.html).

The OpenManuscript format separates the data from the applications 
that edit, display or print it, which is a very powerful mechanism for invention

A writer can use a variety of tools instead of being locked into using a specific one. Software developers can create new tools, and writers can adopt them without any data conversion, or loss of work.

The bigger the community, the better it is for all of us!

## Advantages of OpenManuscript

The advantages of the OpenManuscript format are many:

- OpenManuscript is an open standard, using only common text-based file formats.
  We are developing a community of support around it. Over time, this community 
  will grow to support and include many tools and workflows.
  - Currenly, only **JSON** and **Markdown** files are needed. We use
    [Gruber's](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) specification of
    markdown.
- OpenManuscript invites innovation and expansion, because it is an open
  standard.
- The OpenManuscript standard instantly integrates with any backup system you
  have. Just save files to Dropbox, Google drive, github, or any other cloud-enabled backup system.
- The author can use favorite tools for editing text, **markdown** and **JSON** files.



## The Overall Workflow for OpenManuscript

</p>

As shown in the above diagram, the OpenManuscript format is used by any
compliant editing tool (one that can save text-only files) in the day to day 
work, and when it's time to look at
a final manuscript, share it as a specific document type (Word, PDF, etc.) or
publish it as a final product (ebook, etc.), the writer uses another tool to
create that product.

Using a text-based standard means
the author needn't worry that the format will be unreadable down the road
because the software you used outdated, no longer reads that version of the
output, or is simply gone. 

This repository includes a specification document, simple tools, and an example of the file format.

Keep it simple.
