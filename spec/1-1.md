## OPEN MANUSCRIPT DATA SPECIFICATION

The Open Manuscript data specification is a set of files and directories
contained within a single top level directory. All files are ASCII POSIX text
files, in either `json` or `markdown` format, as required in the specification.

This specification defines the data that OpenManuscript expects and supports.
Other files can appear in directories and subdirectories, and other data can
appear in `json` files, but this data is ignored by the OpenManuscript
specification. Thus, the file format can be extended by other applications.

### Overall Structure

- **manuscript directory** (required). Top level directory. This is 
  the top level of the data. This specification imposes no restrictions on 
  naming this directory.

- **author_file** (required). A properly formatted `JSON` file describing the 
  author of this manuscript. The specification is below. Name is not specified
  by this document. There must be at least one author file.

- **manuscript_file** (required). A properly formatted `JSON` file that 
  describes the names and order of the chapters, and which scenes go into 
  them. The specification is below. Name of this file is not specified by this
  document. There must be at least one manuscript file.

- **scenes/** (required). This is a directory containing ``scene`` files, which are required to be **markdown** format, per the specification below. There may 
  be unused scenes (scenes not noted in a `manuscript.json` file).

    EXAMPLE of manuscript data

    adventure/
        author.json
        manuscript.json
        scenes/
            001.md
            002.md
            003.md
            start.md
            this_scene.md

```

### AUTHOR.JSON File
Metadata description for an author or authors. The metadata is modeled after the
information in the address schema at https://schema.org/address.
The content of the value for each key is not examined for correctness - each is simply treated as a string. Each must follow proper `JSON` formats for strings.

- **version** (required) the version of this specification the file follows. 

- **author** A JSON object. The following [key,value] pairs define an author's
  data.
    - **name** The author's full name. Can be a list of names. The string is not checked for any formatting constraints (required).
    - **surname** A single name, to be included in the header for each manuscript page, per standard manuscript formatting (required).
    - **email** The author's email address (required).
    - **phone** The author's phone number (required).
    - **website** The author's website (optional).
    - **addressCountry** The address' country" (required). 
    - **addressLocality** The address' locality (city) required).
    - **addressRegion** The address' region (state) (optional). As needed, if the country has entities such as states.
    - **postalCode** Zip or other postal code (required).
    - **streetAddress** Street address (required).
    - Other valid `JSON` data may be present, but is not part of this    specification. 

- Other valid `JSON` data may be present, but is not part of this    specification.

### MANUSCRIPT file
The manuscript file defines a series of chapters, each of which is made up of
scenes.

- **version** the version of this specification the file follows. 
- **manuscript** A JSON object. The following [key,value] pairs define
  a manuscript's data.
    - **title** The full title of the manuscript.
    - **runningtitle** A one word title, included in each page's header, per common manuscript formatting. 
    - **chapters** A list of chapters. a `chapter` is defined below. A chapter is an array of scenes, with metadata. 
    - Other valid `JSON` data may be present, but is not part of this    specification.

```
    SPECIFICATION of manuscript.json file
    {
    "version" : String, 
    "manuscript" : {
        "title" : String, 
        "runningtitle" : String, 
        "chapters" : Array.of(Chapter),
        ]
    }
    }

    EXAMPLE
    {
    "version" : "1.1",
    "manuscript" : {
        "title" : "Finding the Story: A Novel",
        "runningtitle" : "finding",

### CHAPTER 
A chapter is a collection of scene files, with additional optional metadata.
Chapters are numbered automatically based on their order in the file.
Scenes are included in the order that they appear in the scene list.

- **required tags** These must be present.
  - **scenes** An array of scene names. These are expected to be present in the
    `scenes` directory, but applications are expected to react gracefully (report
    the missing file, and not crash) if the files do not exist. 
- **optional tags** These are defined by the specification, but need not be present.
  - **desc**  A short description of the chapter, to be used in outlines.
  - **pov**   Point of view of the chapter. Any string is valid.
  - **setting** The setting of the scene. Any string is valid.
  - **story** A description of the story points in a scene. This is used for 
  - **summary** A scene file that is a summary of the chapter. Expected to be in
    the `scenes` directory.
    notes to the author, and is not included in the outline.
  - **tags** An array of strings used to define collections of chapters.
  - **title** The title of the chapter.
  - **tod** Time of day. Any string is valid.
  - Other valid `JSON` data may be present, but is not part of this    
    specification.

```
    CHAPTER specification

    {
        "desc"    : String, 
        "pov"     : String, 
        "scenes"  : Array.of(String),
        "setting" : String, 
        "story"   : String, 
        "summary" : String,

        "title"   : String, 
        "tod"     : String
    }
```
### SCENE.MD file
A scene file is required to be a ``markdown`` file, utilizing the
[commonmark](https://spec.commonmark.org) specification, with the following  
extensions:

- **comments** These are notes in the text that never appear in a final
  rendering. This can be used to comment out text, as well as to include
  comments within the scene file itself. For example, if you want to keep
  a paragraph within the scene file, but not have it appear in any final
  rendering of the file, you can comment it out.

```
    [comment] # ( whatever is in here is ignored )

    [comment] # ( whatever is in here is ignored,
    and it can be multiline.
    )
```
- **notes** These are notes in the text that can be turned on and off. 
  These can be used to intersperse notes throughout the manuscript that are 
  turned off in a final draft, for example. The display of these is up to the
  rendering application, but they must be able to be turned on and off with a
  single option.

```
    This is some text, and it has a note [^first] in it. It's useful if
    you want to remind yourself of something [^second], and have a way of
    controlling whether or not the note appears.

    [^first]: remember to show how the character feels here

    [^second]: and the notes can be 
        multiline, and contain other **formatting**, etc.
        just make sure to indent

        the content until you are done with the note.

```
