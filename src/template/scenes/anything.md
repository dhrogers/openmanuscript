This example shows the minimum you need to describe a manuscript. It's basically
just a list of chapters, each of which is a list of scenes.

You'll notice in the **manuscript.json** file that this chapter only has one 
thing defined: the **scenes** fields. Everything else is optional, because 
**OpenManuscript** tools are required to behave well when information isn't defined.

Also, just remember that the name of the scene file is up to you - numbering
them in order makes it easy to create unique names, but you can name them
anything you want.
